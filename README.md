# ChopSuey - SignalUI Component Library

## Installation

1. Clone this repo
2. `cd` to your local repo and run `./install.sh`

## Updating

1. On master branch `git pull origin master`
2. run `./update.sh`

## Building

`cd` to the local repo and run `gulp`

## Demo

`cd` to the local repo and run `gulp start:demo` and follow the instructions

## Components

Each component resides in a folder under `src/components`.

For example, the `drop-down` component may be found under `src/components/drop-down`.

Each component directory contains a folder for `css`, `js`, and `templates`.

### CSS

`css` should contain a single SASS file named `main.scss` containing all the styles necessary to render all versions of the component.

SASS files for all components will be converted to CSS and concatenated into `dist/components/css/components.css` and `dist/components/css/components.min.css`.

### JS

`js` should contain a single JS file named `main.js` containing the ChopSuey.registerComponent() call for this component along with potential `build.js` and/or `enhance.js` with supporting browserify managed modules. 

JavaScript files for all components will be converted and concatenated into `dist/components/js/components.js` and `dist/components/js/components.min.js`.

### Templates

`templates` should contain one or more templates  named `component-name.mustache` for rendering the entire component, or `component-name-part.mustache` containing sub templates for any HTML that needs to be added on enhancement, no matter how insignificant.

For example, the `drop-down` contains a main template called `drop-down.mustache` and three sub-templates called `drop-down-menu.mustache`, `drop-down-sizer.mustache`, and `drop-down-trigger.mustache`.

### Helpers

Helper functions are also generated to provide native wrappers for generating ChopSuey component markup in various backend languages.

Currently, helper templates are located in `gulp/resources` such as `php-helper.mustache`. These templates use the directory structure of the templates to generate method names for use in a particular language.

Helpers get generated in `dist/helpers` in language specific folders.

ChopSuey currently supports:
* `php`

### Tests
